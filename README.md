# wk1-code-challenge
week one code challenge where you need to complete the following challenges 

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

  The requirment in the challenge is to use a conditional statement be it if,else if or switch and even a ternirary expression.
  it should  take in a grade value and return the appropriate for the grade.
  The condition in if may also require a and (&&) to use a range.
Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
   
   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

  The requirement in to create a function that take in the value of the speed of the car and calculate the demerit value of the speed using the calculation of demerit = (speed-70)5.
  it should return the specified string dependant on the demerit value. 

  CHALLENGE 3
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

  using the above information found in the links derive a function where you can calculate the gross salary (gross salary = basic salary + allowance) and the total tax.
